How to start contribution
----
First of all, make an issue to explain your idea or situation.<br>
When is is decided that you make a source code contribution in the thread, add your copyright notice and make it MIT License when you can do so.

An issue a topic
----
Write one topic to one issue, though it is very small.<br>
Mixture of issues makes it harder to close.

Make an appropriate title
----
Title that you can guess its content is good title.

Don't make a dead link
----
When posting images, it is better upload them rather than external link. Links may be expired in the future. Expired links bother people who comes later.

Write your platform
----
When you post trouble report, write your platform information, e.g., OS, version of Visual studio. It is welcome that you copy and paste the debugger log, but it is optional.
